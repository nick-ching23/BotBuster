## **About The Project**

BotBuster is a Discord bot that utilizes the Veritas backend service. At its core, this bot aims to help identify bots in various Discord groups. Please feel free to view the [Veritas](https://github.com/nick-ching23/pineapple) at the following link. 

## **How BotBuster interacts with Veritas**
Given that our client application is a simple Discord Bot, our bot will simply make an HTTP call to Veritas. Once the request has been processed, the bot will return the response in chat.

## **Bot Buster's Functionality**
BotBuster is an instructive example of an implementation of the Veritas service. At its core, BotButser simply checks every message sent in a discord group chat.

## **How to activate the bot**

**1. Add Veritas to Your Guild**

Add our Discord bot to your guild using the following link:

**[Invite Veritas to Your Guild](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308900909236883476)**


**2. Receive Your Guild ID**

Once Veritas is added to your guild, it will automatically generate a **Guild ID**. This unique ID is required for registration.

</p>


This step ensures your guild is registered in our system, allowing the Veritas API to interact with messages from your guild.


**4. Start Monitoring with Veritas**

To start monitoring messages in your guild, use the following command in Discord:

```plaintext
@Veritas start monitoring
```

</p>


**4. Just type messages**

From now, the system will automatically check each message to determoine if it was generated by generated AI or not. 



**5. Stop Veritas Monitoring**

To stop monitoring messages in your guild, use the following command in Discord:

```plaintext
@Veritas stop monitoring
```

## **Testing for the bot**

Our testing has largely been driven by user-testing. As a discord bot, we implemented some basic unit tests to ensure that the bot correctly starts and stops monitoring. 

Testing can be accomplished by following the above instructions and entering the following command: 

```bash
pytest test_bot.py
```
