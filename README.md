## **About The Project**

BotBuster is a Discord bot that utilizes the Veritas backend service. At its core, this bot aims to help identify bots in various Discord groups. Please feel free to view the [Veritas](https://github.com/nick-ching23/pineapple) at the following link. 

## **How BotBuster interacts with Veritas**
Given that our client application is a simple Discord Bot, our bot will simply make an HTTP call to Veritas. Once the request has been processed, the bot will return the response in chat.
