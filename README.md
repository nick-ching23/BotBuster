## **About The Project**

BotBuster is a Discord bot that utilizes the Veritas backend service. At its core, this bot aims to help identify bots/users generating messages using AI within various Discord groups. Please feel free to view [Veritas](https://github.com/nick-ching23/pineapple) at the following link. 

## **How BotBuster interacts with Veritas**
Our client application is essentially a simple Discord Bot - our bot will simply make an HTTP call to Veritas. Once the request has been processed, the bot will return a relevant response in chat.

## **Bot Buster's Functionality**
BotBuster is an instructive example of an implementation of the Veritas service. At its core, BotButser simply checks every message sent in a discord group chat.

## **Project Requirements** 

To run this bot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Discord Developer Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- `.env` file with the following environment variables:
```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
VERITAS_URL=http://34.70.245.192:8080 # (or) http://localhost:8080 if hosting Veritas locally
 ```
---

## **How to build our project**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nick-ching23/BotBuster.git veritas-discord-bot
cd veritas-discord-bot
```

2. Create a .env file in the root directory:

```plaintext
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
VERITAS_URL=http://34.70.245.192:8080 # (or) http://localhost:8080 if hosting Veritas locally
```

3.	Install dependencies (we recommend doing this within a Python virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the bot locally:
```bash
python app.py
```

## **How to activate the bot**

**1. Add Veritas to Your Guild**

**Option 1 [Easier]: Use a bot hosted by us:**

We have `app.py` running on a configured GCP VM. Add our Discord bot to your guild using the following link: **[Invite Veritas to Your Guild](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308900909236883476)**

**Option 2: Run your own bot:**

To run your own instance of the bot, a discord bot token is necessary.

If you don't have a bot token, you can obtain one by following these steps:
 - Go to the Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
 - Log in with your Discord account, or create an account if you don't have one
 - Click on 'New Application' to create a new bot.
 - Give your application a name and click 'Create'.
 - Navigate to the 'Bot' tab on the left sidebar and click 'Add Bot'.
 - Once the bot is created, you will find a 'Token' section. Click 'Reset Token' to generate a new token.
 - Copy the generated token securely. Set the value of `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` to this token in your `.env` file and follow steps 2 to 4 from the previous section!

To invite the bot:
 - Navigate to the 'OAuth2' tab, then to 'URL Generator'.
 - Under 'Scopes', select 'bot'.
 - Under 'Bot Permissions', select the permissions your bot will need (e.g., 'Send Messages', 'Read Messages' for our bot use)
 - Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

To grant the bot permissions:
 - Navigate to the 'Bot' tab
 - Under 'Privileged Gateway Intents', check 'Server Members Intent' and 'Message Content Intent'.

For more details, you can also check the official Discord bot documentation: https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro

**2. Receive Your Guild ID**

Once Veritas is added to your guild, it will automatically generate a **Guild ID**. This unique ID is required for registration.

</p>

**3. Register Your Organization via Postman**

Use Postman to register your organization. Run the following command:

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/803c8b4d-9069-4e42-ab43-e0585514bda7" width="400">
</p>

This step ensures your guild is registered in our system, allowing the Veritas API to interact with messages from your guild.

**4. Start Monitoring with Veritas**

To start monitoring messages in your guild, use the following command in Discord:

```plaintext
@Veritas start monitoring
```

</p>

**4. Just type messages**

From now, the system will automatically check each message to determine if it was generated by generated AI or not. 



**5. Stop Veritas Monitoring**

To stop monitoring messages in your guild, use the following command in Discord:

```plaintext
@Veritas stop monitoring
```

</p>

## **Testing for the bot**

Our testing has largely been driven by user-testing. As a discord bot, we implemented some basic unit tests to ensure that the bot correctly starts and stops monitoring. 

Testing can be accomplished by following the above instructions and entering the following command: 

```bash
pytest test_bot.py
```
